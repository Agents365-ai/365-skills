## Extensions

Extensions are TypeScript modules that add executable behavior to Pi. Use one when a workflow needs tools, commands, event handlers, model providers, session state, or terminal UI rather than instructions alone.

An extension runs inside the Pi process with the same operating-system permissions. It can inspect prompts, tool calls, files, credentials, and session history, so load extensions only from sources you trust.

Typical extensions add an agent tool, protect paths, confirm dangerous commands, react to session events, modify context, expose a command, or display persistent status.

<a id="writing-an-extension"></a>
<a id="create-an-extension"></a>

## Create and load an extension

An extension exports a default factory that receives `ExtensionAPI`. The factory registers capabilities for the current extension runtime.

Create `~/.pi/agent/extensions/hello.ts`:

```typescript
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  pi.registerCommand("hello", {
    description: "Show a greeting",
    handler: async (name, ctx) => {
      ctx.ui.notify(`Hello, ${name || "world"}!`, "info");
    },
  });
}
```

Start Pi and run `/hello`. During development, load a file directly:

```bash
pi --extension ./hello.ts
```

Pi uses `jiti`, so local TypeScript extensions do not need a separate compilation step. Use [Pi packages](packages.md) for distributed extensions and dependencies.

<a id="extension-locations"></a>
<a id="available-imports"></a>
<a id="choose-where-it-loads"></a>

## Add it to Pi

Place the extension in your user or project extensions directory. Pi loads direct TypeScript or JavaScript files and subdirectories containing an `index.ts` or `index.js` entry point.

Use a single file for a small extension and a directory for a multi-file implementation. Put npm dependencies in a nearby `package.json`. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for conventional locations and [Settings](settings.md#resources) for additional paths.

Reload replaces the extension runtime, so code after `await ctx.reload()` must not reuse state from the old runtime. Only personal and explicit command-line extensions can participate in the `project_trust` event that runs before project extensions load.

<a id="understand-the-lifecycle"></a>

## Respect the runtime lifecycle

The factory can be synchronous or asynchronous. Pi waits for an asynchronous factory before startup continues, allowing it to fetch configuration or register providers needed during startup.

Do not start processes, sockets, watchers, or timers in the factory because some invocations load extensions without starting a session.
Start long-lived resources from `session_start` or from the command or tool that needs them.
Close session-scoped resources from an idempotent `session_shutdown` handler.

A run proceeds from input and `before_agent_start`, through model, message, and tool events, to `agent_end`.
Automatic retries, recovery, compaction, or queued work can continue afterward.
<a id="agent_start--agent_end--agent_before_settle--agent_settled"></a>

`agent_before_settle` is the final actionable boundary: it can append entries and request one continuation.
`agent_settled` is final and notification-only; use it when an integration needs to know Pi will not continue automatically.

<a id="extensionapi-methods"></a>

## Choose an integration point

| Capability | Main API |
|---|---|
| Observe or modify lifecycle behavior | `pi.on()` |
| Add a model-callable operation | `pi.registerTool()` |
| Add a `/` command | `pi.registerCommand()` |
| Add a shortcut or CLI flag | `pi.registerShortcut()` or `pi.registerFlag()` |
| Send user or custom messages | `pi.sendUserMessage()` or `pi.sendMessage()` |
| Persist non-context session data | `pi.appendEntry()` |
| Change active tools, model, or thinking level | Session control methods on `pi` |
| Add a model provider | `pi.registerProvider()` |
| Add terminal rendering | Renderer registration and `ctx.ui` |
| Communicate with another extension | `pi.events` |

Use the exported declarations in [`extensions/types.ts`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts) for exact event, context, tool, and result types.

## Follow the extension contracts

<a id="events"></a>
<a id="work-with-events"></a>

### Events and concurrency

Handlers run in extension load and registration order. `pi.on()` returns a function that unsubscribes that registration; changes do not affect a dispatch already in progress.
Some events notify; others transform data, replace results, or cancel an operation.
Use each event’s declared result type rather than assuming every return value has an effect.

Events cover resource discovery, sessions, agent and message lifecycle, providers, tools, and raw input.

`before_agent_start` exposes both the current prompt and its structured `systemPromptOptions`. Prefer changing prompt sections, selected tools, or guidelines so Pi can append a transcript delta. Returning `systemPrompt`, or setting `forceSystemPrompt`, replaces the whole prompt for that run while the transcript continues recording the structured sections. Providers receive the forced text as their leading system prompt.

`message_end` can replace a finalized message while preserving its role. `tool_call` can mutate input or block execution. `tool_result` handlers compose, with each handler seeing prior changes.

<a id="context_with_system"></a>

`context` transforms conversation messages without prompt and tool system messages; Pi restores that state afterward. Use `context_with_system` only when a request-local transformation must own the complete transcript, and keep a system message at index zero.

`turn_end` and `agent_before_settle` are actionable boundaries. Their handlers can chain proposed `custom`, `custom_message`, `context_edit`, or `compaction` entries and return `continue: true` for one next model request. Guard continuation conditions because an unconditional continuation can loop. Use the exported event declarations for the complete validation and ordering contract.

<a id="cache_warming_decision"></a>

`cache_warming_decision` can override an idle prompt-cache refresh with `{ action: "warm" }` or `{ action: "stop" }`. The last handler that returns an action wins.

Tool calls from one assistant message can run in parallel.
Do not assume a sibling call or result exists when another tool event runs.
Use `ctx.signal` for nested work owned by an active turn; commands and idle session events often have no operation signal.

A `user_bash` handler that returns `undefined` passes the command to the next handler and then to local execution if no handler handles it. Returning `operations` or `result` stops propagation. A handler failure blocks the command rather than falling through to local execution.

<a id="custom-tools"></a>
<a id="register-tools"></a>

### Tools

A custom tool defines a name, model-facing description, TypeBox parameter schema, and `execute()` function.
Its result requires model-facing `content` and a `details` field for rendering or state reconstruction.
Use `details: undefined` when there are no structured details. If the tool makes nested model calls, include their `usage` in the result so session totals remain accurate.

Throw from `execute()` to produce a failed tool result.
Returning an object does not mark it as an error.
Return `terminate: true` only when the agent should skip its automatic follow-up after every completed tool in that batch agrees to terminate.

Use sequential execution when tools share mutable in-memory state.
File-mutating tools should wrap the complete read-modify-write operation with `withFileMutationQueue()`.
Truncate large model-facing results and tell the model where to read the complete output.

See [`hello.ts`](../examples/extensions/hello.ts), [`todo.ts`](../examples/extensions/todo.ts), [`dynamic-tools.ts`](../examples/extensions/dynamic-tools.ts), and [`truncated-tool.ts`](../examples/extensions/truncated-tool.ts).

### Activate tools dynamically

Register every tool first, keep optional tools inactive, and use `pi.setActiveTools()` from a loader tool to select the desired active tools. Names must already be registered; unknown names are ignored.

Pi records the initial prompt and tool set in the transcript's first system message, then appends tool and prompt changes before the next model request. Providers that cannot represent the transition receive a complete transcript checkpoint, which can invalidate the cached prefix.

<a id="extensioncontext"></a>
<a id="extensioncommandcontext"></a>
<a id="use-extension-context"></a>

### Context and session changes

`ExtensionContext` provides the working directory, mode, UI, session manager, model runtime, abort signal, context usage, and controls for compaction and shutdown.
Use `ctx.modelRegistry.streamSimple()` for provider-neutral nested model calls.

Command handlers receive `ExtensionCommandContext`, which adds operations for waiting until idle, reloading, tree navigation, and session replacement.
These operations are command-only because calling them from lifecycle handlers can deadlock the runtime.

Session replacement invalidates the old context. Capture only plain data before switching, then use the fresh context supplied to `withSession` for session-bound work.

<a id="state-management"></a>
<a id="persist-state"></a>

### State

Choose storage based on how state participates in the conversation:

| State | Storage |
|---|---|
| Tool state that follows the active branch | Tool-result `details` |
| Durable data excluded from model context | `pi.appendEntry()` |
| Custom content stored and sent to the model | `pi.sendMessage()` |
| Data outside one session | External storage |

Reconstruct branch-sensitive state from `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` during `session_start`.
Do not rebuild it from every file entry because abandoned branches represent alternative histories.
Register an entry or message renderer when custom stored content should appear in the transcript.

<a id="custom-ui"></a>
<a id="mode-behavior"></a>
<a id="interact-with-the-user"></a>
<a id="account-for-each-mode"></a>

### UI and modes

`ctx.ui` provides dialogs, notifications, status text, widgets, titles, editor access, and custom components.
Use `ctx.ui.custom()` only when the interaction needs its own rendering and input.
See [Terminal UI](tui.md) for component, focus, overlay, theme, and performance guidance.

Extensions load in interactive, RPC, JSON, and print modes.
Interactive mode provides the complete terminal UI.
RPC can forward supported dialogs and notifications through the [RPC Extension UI protocol](rpc-extension-ui.md), but not custom terminal components; JSON and print modes have no UI.
Guard terminal-only behavior with `ctx.mode === "tui"` and use `ctx.hasUI` for interactions supported by interactive and RPC clients.

Keep tool and event behavior independent from rendering so non-interactive modes remain functional.

<a id="error-handling"></a>
<a id="handle-errors-and-shutdown"></a>

### Errors and cleanup

Pi reports handler errors and continues where possible. A `tool_call` handler failure blocks the tool as a fail-safe; a tool execution failure becomes an error result for the model.

Release resources in `session_shutdown` even when normal operation attempted cleanup.
Keep cleanup idempotent because cancellation, reload, session replacement, and process exit can converge on the same path.
Use `ctx.shutdown()` to request an orderly process shutdown.

## Examples and reference

The checked [extension examples](../examples/extensions/) cover tools, lifecycle events, commands, flags, shortcuts, state, rendering, providers, OAuth, remote execution, and terminal components.
Start with the smallest example matching your integration point.

Use [Custom Providers](custom-provider.md) for model-service integrations, [Terminal UI](tui.md) for custom components, and [Pi Packages](packages.md) to install or distribute extensions with other resources.

## Skills

Skills give Pi specialized instructions and supporting files for a particular kind of work. Pi advertises each available skill by name and description, then loads its full instructions only when the task calls for them.

Use a skill when a workflow needs more context than a prompt template but does not need a new executable integration point. Skills can bundle scripts, references, and assets alongside their instructions.

Pi implements the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Most invalid fields produce warnings rather than stopping startup.

## Create a skill

A skill is a directory containing `SKILL.md`:

```text
pdf-tools/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
│   └── extract.sh
├── references/
│   └── formats.md
└── assets/
    └── template.json
```

Start `SKILL.md` with frontmatter followed by direct instructions:

```markdown
---
name: pdf-tools
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files. Use when reading, converting, or inspecting PDFs.
---

# PDF tools

Read `references/formats.md` before converting a document. Run scripts relative to this skill directory.
```

The description determines when the model considers loading the skill. State both what the skill does and when it applies. Avoid descriptions such as “Helps with PDFs,” which do not provide enough routing information.

Use relative paths from the skill directory when referring to bundled files. Pi tells the model where the skill lives so it can resolve those paths.

## Understand how skills load

At startup, Pi scans configured skill locations and adds each skill’s name, description, and path to the system prompt. It does not add the full instructions.

When a task matches, the model reads `SKILL.md` and follows its instructions. This keeps detailed guidance out of context until it is needed. A model might fail to load a relevant skill, so use `/skill:name` when you need to force it.

Arguments after `/skill:name` are appended to the loaded instructions as a user request:

```text
/skill:pdf-tools extract report.pdf
```

Set `disable-model-invocation: true` in frontmatter when a skill should be available only through its explicit command. The `enableSkillCommands` [setting](settings.md) controls whether skill commands appear in interactive command discovery; manually entered `/skill:name` commands still work.

<a id="choose-where-it-loads"></a>

## Add it to Pi

Place the skill in your user or project skills directory. Directories containing `SKILL.md` are discovered recursively.

Pi also supports the Agent Skills locations `~/.agents/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. Project `.agents/skills/` directories are discovered from the working directory through its ancestors, stopping at the repository root when one exists.

Pi accepts some standalone Markdown skills, but a directory containing `SKILL.md` is the portable form and should be preferred. See [Settings](settings.md#resources) and [Pi Packages](packages.md) for additional locations.

Project skills can instruct the model to run scripts or modify files. Review unfamiliar skills and their supporting files before granting project trust.

## Write portable frontmatter

The Agent Skills specification defines these fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name` | Command and display name |
| `description` | Routing description shown to the model |
| `license` | License name or bundled license file |
| `compatibility` | Environment requirements |
| `metadata` | Additional key-value metadata |
| `allowed-tools` | Experimental pre-approved tool list |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Hide the skill from automatic model selection |

Names use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, with no leading, trailing, or consecutive hyphens. They can contain at most 64 characters; descriptions can contain at most 1024.

Pi neither requires nor warns when the declared name differs from the parent directory. Other Agent Skills implementations may enforce that requirement, so matching names remain the portable choice.

Malformed `SKILL.md` files and declared skills without descriptions are not loaded. Name collisions keep the first discovered skill and produce a warning.

## Validate and share a skill

Run Pi from a location where the skill is discoverable, then inspect the startup diagnostics and `/skill:name` command. Run `/reload` after editing a skill during an active session.

Use a [Pi package](packages.md) to distribute one or more skills through npm or git. Keep environment setup inside the skill and declare any required runtime dependencies in the package.

For examples, see the [Anthropic skills collection](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) and [Pi skills collection](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills).

## Prompt Templates

Prompt templates turn Markdown files into reusable `/` commands. Use one when you want to reuse the same prompt without adding executable behavior or a larger set of supporting instructions.

A template can accept arguments and appear in command completion. Pi can load templates from personal configuration, project configuration, an explicit path, or a Pi package. Project configuration loads only after project trust is granted.

## Create a template

Create `~/.pi/agent/prompts/review.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Review staged git changes
argument-hint: "[focus]"
---
Review the staged changes. Focus on ${1:-correctness, security, and error handling}.
```

The filename becomes the command name, so this template is available as `/review`. The `description` appears in command completion. If it is omitted, Pi uses the first non-empty line.

`argument-hint` is optional. Use `<angle brackets>` for required arguments and `[square brackets]` for optional arguments.

Run `/reload` after adding or changing a template in an active session.

<a id="invoke-a-template"></a>

## Use a template

Type the template command in the editor:

```text
/review
/review concurrency
```

Pi expands the template before the resulting text enters the agent. Extensions receive the raw input first through the `input` event unless an extension command with the same name handles it.

Templates support these substitutions:

| Syntax | Result |
|---|---|
| `$1`, `$2`, … | One positional argument |
| `$@` or `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments joined with spaces |
| `${1:-default}` | First argument, or a default value |
| `${@:-default}` | All arguments, or a default value |
| `${@:N}` | Arguments starting at position `N` |
| `${@:N:L}` | `L` arguments starting at position `N` |

Arguments follow shell-like quoting, so `/review "API compatibility"` supplies one argument containing a space.

<a id="choose-where-it-loads"></a>

## Add it to Pi

Place the template in your user or project prompt directory. Conventional prompt directories load direct `.md` children only.

Settings and packages can select nested Markdown files; a package manifest can narrow discovery with explicit paths and globs. See [Settings](settings.md#resources) and [Pi Packages](packages.md) for these options.

Project templates become commands in the editor after trust is granted. Review their content before trusting an unfamiliar project. See [Security](security.md#understand-project-trust).

---

## Themes

Themes control the colors Pi uses in interactive mode and HTML exports. Pi includes `dark` and `light` themes. You can select one theme, follow your terminal's light or dark appearance, or create your own palette.

<a id="selecting-a-theme"></a>

## Choose a theme

Open `/settings` and select **Theme**. You can use one theme for every terminal appearance or choose separate themes for light and dark terminals.

The selection is saved as the `theme` [setting](settings.md#terminal-and-display):

```json
{
  "theme": "dark"
}
```

Automatic mode stores the light theme first and the dark theme second:

```json
{
  "theme": "light/dark"
}
```

When automatic mode is active, Pi changes themes when the terminal reports an appearance change. Theme names cannot contain `/` because Pi reserves it for this setting format.

Use `--use-theme` to choose the initial theme for one invocation without changing the saved setting:

```bash
pi --use-theme light
pi --use-theme light/dark
```

See [CLI resources](cli.md#resources) for the command-line option.

## Create a custom theme

Copy one of the [built-in themes](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/theme) or create a new JSON file conforming to the [schema](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/theme/theme-schema.json).

1. Save the file as `<agent-dir>/themes/my-theme.json`. The agent directory defaults to `~/.pi/agent`.
2. Set its `name` to `my-theme`.
3. Change values in `vars` and `colors`.
4. Select `my-theme` through `/settings`.

Use the theme name as the filename. Pi hot-reloads the active user theme only from `<agent-dir>/themes/<name>.json`. Run `/reload` after adding or changing a theme from any other source.

## Understand the theme file

| Property | Required | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `$schema` | No | Enables editor validation and completion against Pi's published schema. |
| `name` | Yes | Identifies the theme in selectors and settings. It must be unique and cannot contain `/`. |
| `vars` | No | Defines reusable color values. Variables can reference other variables. |
| `colors` | Yes | Assigns colors to terminal UI roles. The schema identifies required and optional roles. |
| `export` | No | Overrides page and panel backgrounds in HTML exports. |

A color can be written in four forms:

| Form | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| RGB hexadecimal | `"#00aaff"` | A six-digit RGB color. |
| 256-color index | `39` | An ANSI palette index from `0` through `255`. |
| Variable reference | `"primary"` | The value of an entry in `vars`. |
| Terminal default | `""` | The terminal's default foreground or background color. |

Pi resolves chained variable references. A missing variable or circular reference makes the theme invalid. Hexadecimal colors use truecolor when supported and are approximated in terminals limited to 256 colors. If colors differ from their hexadecimal values, check your terminal's truecolor detection and contrast settings. See [Configure Your Terminal](terminal-setup.md#override-detected-capabilities).

Use the [theme JSON schema](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/theme/theme-schema.json) for the exact properties, required colors, and accepted value types.

Pi reports invalid theme files during startup and `/reload`.

## Find the color to change

Theme colors describe interface roles rather than individual components. Use these groups to find the relevant part of the schema:

| Area | Color names |
|---|---|
| General interface | `accent`, `border*`, `text`, `muted`, `dim`, `success`, `error`, `warning` |
| Selection and fullscreen | `selectedBg`, `searchMatch*`, `scrollbar*` |
| Messages | `userMessage*`, `customMessage*`, `thinkingText` |
| Tool execution | `toolPendingBg`, `toolSuccessBg`, `toolErrorBg`, `toolTitle`, `toolOutput` |
| Markdown | `md*` |
| Tool diffs | `toolDiff*` |
| Syntax highlighting | `syntax*` |
| Editor modes | `thinking*`, `bashMode` |
| HTML export | `export.pageBg`, `export.cardBg`, `export.infoBg` |

The schema is the format reference. The built-in themes provide complete values that you can copy and adjust.

Five colors are optional and inherit another color when omitted:

| Optional color | Fallback |
|---|---|
| `scrollbarTrack` | `muted` |
| `scrollbarThumb` | `text` |
| `searchMatchBg` | `selectedBg` |
| `searchMatchText` | `text` |
| `thinkingMax` | `thinkingXhigh` |

If `export` colors are omitted, Pi derives HTML page and panel backgrounds from `userMessageBg`.

## Load a theme from a project or package

Place a project theme in `.pi/themes/`. Project themes load only after [project trust](security.md#understand-project-trust) is granted.

You can also load theme files and directories through the `themes` setting or distribute them in a Pi package. See [Configuration](configuration.md), [Settings](settings.md#resources), and [Pi Packages](packages.md).

Each loaded theme must have a unique name. Pi reports duplicate names as resource collisions.

---

## Pi Packages

Pi packages install and distribute extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes as one unit. Use a package when a customization should be shared through npm or git, or when several resources belong together.

A package is an ordinary directory or npm package. It can expose conventional resource directories, declare explicit paths under the `pi` key in `package.json`, and carry its own runtime dependencies.

## Install and manage packages

Install from npm, git, or a local path:

```bash
pi install npm:@example/pi-tools@1.0.0
pi install git:github.com/example/pi-tools@v1
pi install ./local-package
```

`pi list` shows configured packages. Use `pi remove <source>` to remove one and `pi update --extensions` to reconcile package installations. See [Command Line](cli.md#package-commands) for every package command and option.

Personal installs are written to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. Add `--local` or `-l` to write the package declaration to `.pi/settings.json`. Pi reads declarations from that file only after project trust is granted.

Project packages are installed and loaded only after project trust is resolved. Packages can execute extension code and can include skills that instruct the model to run programs. Review third-party package source before installing it. Review project package declarations before granting project trust.

Use `--extension` or `-e` to try a package for one invocation without adding it to settings:

```bash
pi -e npm:@example/pi-tools
```

## Choose a source

| Source | Example | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| npm | `npm:@example/pi-tools@1.0.0` | Installed under the Pi npm directory |
| git | `git:github.com/example/pi-tools@v1` | Cloned and reconciled to the selected ref |
| URL | `https://github.com/example/pi-tools` | Treated as a git source |
| Local | `./pi-tools` | Loaded from the resolved path without copying |

Versioned npm specifications are pinned. Git tags and commits are also pinned; package updates reconcile the checkout but do not move a configured ref.

Relative local paths resolve from the settings file that contains them. A file path loads one extension. A directory follows normal package discovery rules.

## Create a package

The simplest package uses conventional directories:

```text
my-pi-package/
├── package.json
├── extensions/
├── skills/
├── prompts/
└── themes/
```

Without a `pi` manifest, Pi discovers TypeScript and JavaScript extensions, skill directories, Markdown prompts, and JSON themes from those directories.

Use an explicit manifest when resources live elsewhere or need filtering:

```json
{
  "name": "my-pi-package",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./src/extension.ts"],
    "skills": ["./resources/skills"],
    "prompts": ["./resources/prompts/*.md"],
    "themes": ["./resources/themes/*.json"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the package root. Arrays accept glob patterns and exclusions. List dot-prefixed or symlinked resource roots directly when traversal through a glob would not discover them.

The `pi-package` keyword makes an npm package eligible for discovery in the [Pi package gallery](https://pi.dev/packages). Optional `pi.image` and `pi.video` fields add gallery previews.

## Declare dependencies

Put runtime packages imported by extensions in `dependencies`. Pi installs package dependencies when it installs an npm or git source.

Pi supplies these packages to extensions and skills:

- `@earendil-works/pi-ai`
- `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`
- `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
- `@earendil-works/pi-tui`
- `typebox`

Declare imported Pi packages in `peerDependencies` with a `"*"` range and do not bundle them. Other Pi packages used as dependencies must be included in the published tarball and referenced through their `node_modules` resource paths.

Installed packages load with separate module roots. Do not rely on two packages sharing one dependency instance or one package resolving another package’s undeclared dependency.

## Select package resources

The object form in settings narrows which resources load from a package:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "npm:@example/pi-tools",
      "extensions": ["extensions/*.ts", "!extensions/legacy.ts"],
      "skills": [],
      "prompts": ["prompts/review.md"]
    }
  ]
}
```

For each resource type:

- Omit the property to load everything allowed by the package.
- Use `[]` to load none of that type.
- Use `!pattern` to exclude glob matches.
- Use `+path` to include one exact allowed path.
- Use `-path` to exclude one exact path.

Filters narrow the package manifest. They do not expose resources that the package itself did not declare.

Run `pi config` to enable or disable discovered resources. It starts with personal configuration; press Tab to switch scope, or run `pi config --local` to start with project overrides.

## Understand scope and identity

The same package can appear in personal and project settings. A project entry normally replaces the personal entry. With `autoload: false`, the project entry instead acts as a filtering delta over the personal package.

Pi identifies npm packages by package name, git packages by repository URL without the ref, and local packages by resolved absolute path. This prevents the same package from loading twice through equivalent declarations.

Use [Extensions](extensions.md), [Skills](skills.md), [Prompt Templates](prompt-templates.md), and [Themes](themes.md) to design each resource before packaging it.
