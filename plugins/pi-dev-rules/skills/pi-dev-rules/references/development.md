## Monorepo Overview

Pi is a minimal, extensible agent harness that you can make your own.

Adapt Pi to your workflows, not the other way around. Customize Pi with [extensions](packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md), [skills](packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md), [prompt templates](packages/coding-agent/docs/prompt-templates.md), and [themes](packages/coding-agent/docs/themes.md). Bundle them as [Pi packages](packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md) and share via npm or git.

Pi ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub-agents and plan mode. Ask Pi to build what you want, or install a package that does it your way.

Use Pi [interactively](packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md), automate it in [print or JSON mode](packages/coding-agent/docs/cli.md), control it over [RPC](packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md), or build apps with the [Pi TypeScript SDK](packages/coding-agent/docs/sdk.md). See [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw/OpenClaw) for a real-world integration.

## Getting started

Install the command-line interface:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

```shell
powershell -c "irm https://pi.dev/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer pins all dependencies and updates Pi with `pi update`. Alternatively, install directly with npm, which does not pin transitive dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Pi requires Node.js 22.19 or newer. The macOS, Linux, and Windows installers can install it if needed. Pi does not require dependency lifecycle scripts for a normal npm installation.

Start Pi in the directory where you want it to work:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pi
```

For a built-in AI provider, run `/login` inside Pi to connect a subscription or API key. Then give Pi a task.

See the [documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest) for full setup and usage instructions, or [visit pi.dev](https://pi.dev) for demos.

## Run with Nix

```bash
nix run github:earendil-works/pi/stable
```

`stable` points at the latest release. Install it with `nix profile add github:earendil-works/pi/stable` and update with `nix profile upgrade pi`. Use a release tag such as `github:earendil-works/pi/v1.0.0` to pin a version, or `github:earendil-works/pi` for unreleased changes on `main`. Nix builds Pi from source.

Supports ARM64 and x86-64 on Linux and macOS. Use `nix build .` or `nix run .` to build or run your checkout.

Nix builds are offline, so the bundled model data comes from a pi.dev model catalog revision pinned in `nix/model-catalog.json`. At runtime, Pi still overlays newer catalog data from pi.dev as usual. The Nix workflow replaces the pin on `main` when it no longer matches the checkout, for example after a provider is added or gains a new model type. To refresh it by hand:

```bash
npm run update:model-catalog-pin
```

## Packages

For Slack/chat automation and workflows see [earendil-works/pi-chat](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-chat).

## Permissions & Containerization

Pi does not include a built-in permission system for restricting filesystem, process, network, or credential access. By default, it runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it.

If you need stronger boundaries, containerize or sandbox Pi. See [packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) for three patterns:

- **Gondolin extension**: keep `pi` and provider auth on the host while routing built-in tools and `!` commands into a local Linux micro-VM.
- **Plain Docker**: run the whole `pi` process in a local container for simple isolation.
- **OpenShell**: run the whole `pi` process in a policy-controlled sandbox.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project-specific rules (for both humans and agents).  Longer term plans for Pi can also be found in [RFCs](https://rfc.earendil.com/keyword/pi/).

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts  # Install all dependencies without running lifecycle scripts
npm run build         # Refresh model data, then build all packages
npm run build:offline # Rebuild using existing model data without network access
npm run check         # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
./pi-test.sh         # Run pi from sources (can be run from any directory)
```

## Building standalone binaries from release source

GitHub releases include a versioned source archive covered by the release's `SHA256SUMS` file. Extract it and run the same build script used for the official standalone binaries:

```bash
VERSION="<release-version>"
tar -xzf "pi-${VERSION}-source.tar.gz"
cd "pi-${VERSION}"
./scripts/build-binaries.sh --offline-model-data --platform linux-x64 --out "$PWD/out"
```

The archive includes release model data and native prebuilds. `--offline-model-data` uses that model data without refreshing provider catalogs. The script installs dependencies and builds the executable with its runtime assets; pass `--skip-install` if dependencies are already provided.

## Supply-chain hardening

We treat npm dependency changes as reviewed code changes.

- Direct external dependencies are pinned to exact versions. Internal workspace packages remain version-ranged.
- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true` and `min-release-age=2` to avoid same-day dependency releases during npm resolution.
- `package-lock.json` is the dependency ground truth. Pre-commit blocks accidental lockfile commits unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1` is set.
- `npm run check` verifies pinned direct deps, native TypeScript import compatibility, and the generated coding-agent install lock.
- The pi.dev installer installs from `packages/coding-agent/install-lock/`, generated from the root lockfile, to pin transitive deps. The npm package does not pin transitive deps.
- Release smoke tests use `npm run release:local` to build, pack, and create isolated npm and Bun installs outside the repo before tagging a release.
- Local release installs, documented npm installs, and `pi update --self` use `--ignore-scripts` where supported.
- CI installs with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and a scheduled GitHub workflow runs `npm audit --omit=dev` plus `npm audit signatures --omit=dev`.
- Install lock generation has an explicit allowlist for dependency lifecycle scripts; new lifecycle-script deps fail checks until reviewed.

## Share your OSS coding agent sessions

If you use Pi or other coding agents for open source work, please share your sessions.

Public OSS session data helps improve coding agents with real-world tasks, tool use, failures, and fixes instead of toy benchmarks.

For the full explanation, see [this post on X](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2037811643774652911).

To publish sessions, use [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). Read its README.md for setup instructions. All you need is a Hugging Face account, the Hugging Face CLI, and `pi-share-hf`.

You can also watch [this video](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2041151967695634619), where I show how I publish my `pi-mono` sessions.

I regularly publish my own `pi-mono` work sessions here:

## Development Rules

## Conversational Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")
- Technical prose only, be direct
- Use concise, clear, simple language. Define unavoidable jargon before using it.
- Explain non-trivial designs and problems as: problem, concrete example or short trace, then solution. State why the solution is necessary and distinguish it from optional complexity.
- Prefer concrete behavior and small illustrations over abstract summaries, dense terminology, or unexplained lists of changes.
- When the user asks a question, answer it first before making edits or running implementation commands.
- When responding to user feedback or an analysis, explicitly say whether you agree or disagree before saying what you changed.

## Code Quality

- Read files in full before wide-ranging changes, before editing files you have not fully inspected, and when asked to investigate or audit. Do not rely on search snippets for broad changes.
- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Inline single-line helpers that have only one call site.
- Check node_modules for external API types; don't guess.
- **No inline imports** (`await import()`, `import("pkg").Type`, dynamic type imports). Top-level imports only.
- In `packages/coding-agent`, resolve package assets through helpers in `src/config.ts`. Do not use `__dirname` directly; the helpers account for source checkouts, npm installations, and standalone binaries.
- Never remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated deps; upgrade the dep instead.
- Use only erasable TypeScript syntax (Node strip-only mode) in code checked by the root config (`packages/*/src`, `packages/*/test`, `packages/coding-agent/examples`): no parameter properties, `enum`, `namespace`/`module`, `import =`, `export =`, or other constructs needing JS emit. Use explicit fields with constructor assignments.
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears intentional.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless the user asks for it.
- Never hardcode key checks (e.g. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`). Add defaults to `DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS` so they stay configurable.
- Never modify `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` directly; update `packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts` instead, then regenerate. Including the resulting `models.generated.ts` diff is always OK, even if regeneration includes unrelated upstream model metadata changes.

## Commands

- After code changes (not docs): `npm run check` (full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing. Does not run tests.
- Never run `npm run build` or `npm test` unless requested by the user.
- Never run the full vitest suite directly: it includes e2e tests that activate when endpoint/auth env vars are present. For all non-e2e tests, run `./test.sh` from the repo root. Otherwise run specific tests from the package root:
  - Vitest: `node "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js" --run test/specific.test.ts`
  - `packages/tui` (`node:test`): `node --test test/specific.test.ts`
- If you create or modify a test file, run it and iterate on test or implementation until it passes.
- For `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/`, use `test/suite/harness.ts` + the faux provider. No real provider APIs, keys, or paid tokens.
- When regressions tests for fixing a github issue, add a comment with the github issue number next to the test.
- For ad-hoc scripts, `write` them to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp`), run, edit if needed, remove when done. Don't embed multi-line scripts in `bash` commands.
- Never commit unless the user asks.

## Dependency and Install Security

- Treat npm dep and lockfile changes as reviewed code. Direct external deps stay pinned to exact versions.
- When updating `undici`, you MUST read its changelog/release notes for the target version and evaluate whether any changes may affect functionality before applying the update.
- Hydrate/update locally with `npm install --ignore-scripts`; clean/CI-style with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. Don't run lifecycle scripts unless the user asks.
- If dep metadata changes, refresh `package-lock.json` with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`.
- If `packages/coding-agent/install-lock/` needs regen, run `node scripts/generate-coding-agent-install-lock.mjs` (verify with `--check` or `npm run check`). New deps with lifecycle scripts require review and an explicit allowlist entry in that script; never add one silently.
- Pre-commit blocks lockfile commits unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1`. Don't bypass unless the user wants the lockfile change committed.

## Git

Multiple pi sessions may be running in this cwd at the same time, each modifying different files. Git operations that touch unstaged, staged, or untracked files outside your own changes will stomp on other sessions' work. Follow these rules:

Committing:

- Only commit files YOU changed in THIS session.
- Stage explicit paths (`git add <path1> <path2>`); never `git add -A` / `git add .`.
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging your files.
- `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` may always be included alongside your files.
- Message format: `{feat,fix,docs}[(ai,tui,agent,coding-agent)]: <commit message> (optionally multiple lines)`. Message is informative and concise.

Never run (destroys other agents' work or bypasses checks):

- `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash`, `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit --no-verify`.

If rebase conflicts occur:

- Resolve conflicts only in files you modified.
- If a conflict is in a file you did not modify, abort and ask the user.
- Never force push.

## Issues and PRs

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contributor gate (auto-close workflows, `lgtm`/`lgtmi`, quality bar).

When reviewing PRs:

- Do not run `gh pr checkout`, `git switch`, or otherwise move the worktree to the PR branch unless the user explicitly asks.
- Use `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh api`, and local `git show`/`git diff` against fetched refs to inspect PR metadata, commits, and patches without changing branches.
- If you need PR file contents, fetch/read them into temporary files or use `git show <ref>:<path>` without switching branches.

When creating issues:

- Add `pkg:*` labels for affected packages (`pkg:agent`, `pkg:ai`, `pkg:coding-agent`, `pkg:tui`); use all that apply.

When posting issue/PR comments:

- Write the comment to a temp file and post with `gh issue/pr comment --body-file` (never multi-line markdown via `--body`).
- Keep comments concise, technical, in the user's tone.
- End every AI-posted comment with the AI-generated disclaimer line specified by the originating prompt (e.g. `This comment is AI-generated by `/wr``).

When closing issues via commit:

- Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the message so merging auto-closes the issue. For multiple issues, repeat the keyword per issue (`closes #1, closes #2`); a shared keyword (`closes #1, #2`) only closes the first.

## Testing pi Interactive Mode with tmux

For testing pi's interactive mode, load and follow [.pi/skills/interactive-testing.md](.pi/skills/interactive-testing.md).

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (one per package).

Sections under `## [Unreleased]`: `### Breaking Changes` (API changes requiring migration), `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`.

Rules:

- All new entries go under `## [Unreleased]`. Read the full section first and append to existing subsections; never duplicate them.
- Released version sections (e.g. `## [0.12.2]`) are immutable; never modify them.
- Do not create changelog entries when working on a branch other than `main` or pull request

Attribution:

- Internal (from issues): `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/123))`
- External contributions: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Releasing

For release preparation, publishing, verification, or recovery, load and follow [.pi/skills/release.md](.pi/skills/release.md).

## User Override

If the user's instructions conflict with any rule in this document, ask for explicit confirmation before overriding. Only then execute their instructions.

---

## Contributing

This guide exists to save both sides time.

## Philosophy

First things first: **pi's core is minimal**.

If your feature does not belong in the core, it should be an extension. PRs that bloat the core will likely be rejected.

Pi's core exists to be minimal and to be extensible so that it can be influenced and manipulated by extensions.  Even hook points for extensions however should be well considered and discussed to avoid adding unmaintainable bloat and complex interactions.

## The One Rule

**You must understand your code.** If you cannot explain what your changes do and how they interact with the rest of the system, your PR will be closed.

Using AI to write code is fine. Submitting AI-generated slop without understanding it is not.

If you use an agent, run it from the `pi` root directory so it picks up `AGENTS.md` automatically. Your agent must follow the rules and guidelines in that file.

## Contribution Gate

All issues and PRs from new contributors are auto-closed by default.

Issues submitted Friday through Sunday are not guaranteed to be reviewed.  If something is urgent, ask on Discord: https://discord.com/invite/3cU7Bz4UPx

Maintainers review auto-closed issues daily and reopen worthwhile ones. Issues that do not meet the quality bar below will not be reopened or receive a reply.

Approval happens through maintainer replies on issues:

- `lgtmi`: your future issues will not be auto-closed
- `lgtm`: your future issues and PRs will not be auto-closed

The command must be at the start of the reply (optionally after one or more `@username` mentions) or at the end. `lgtmi` does not grant rights to submit PRs. Only `lgtm` grants rights to submit PRs.

## Quality Bar For Issues

If you open an issue, you must use one of the two GitHub issue templates.

If you open an issue, keep it short, concrete, and worth reading.

- Keep it concise. If it does not fit on one screen, it is too long.
- Write in your own voice (do not use an LLM to generate text, if you must, follow up with a clearly AI labeled comment).
- State the bug or request clearly.
- Explain why it matters.
- If you want to implement the change yourself, say so.

If the issue is real and written well, a maintainer may reopen it or reply with `lgtmi` or `lgtm` in the command position described above.

## Blocking

If you ignore this document twice, or if you spam the tracker with agent-generated issues, your GitHub account will be permanently blocked.

If you send a large volume of issues through automation, your GitHub account will be permanently blocked. No taksies backsies.

## Before Submitting a PR

Do not open a PR unless you have already been approved by a maintainer using `lgtm` in the command position described above.

Before submitting a PR:

```bash
npm run check
./test.sh
```

Both must pass.

Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md`. Changelog entries are added by maintainers.

If you are adding a new provider to `packages/ai`, see `AGENTS.md` for required tests.

## Questions?

Ask on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nKXTsAcmbT).

## FAQ

### Why are new issues and PRs auto-closed?

pi receives more issues than the maintainers can responsibly review in real time. Many reports do not meet the quality bar in this guide or do not follow CONTRIBUTING.md. Some are slung at the repository mindlessly via an agent instead of being reviewed and shaped by the person submitting them. Auto-closing creates a buffer so maintainers can review the tracker on their own schedule and reopen the issues that meet the quality bar.

### Why are weekend issues lower priority?

We triage the tracker during working hours. That means more issues can accumulate over the weekend. Anything submitted Friday through Sunday may be missed or given lower priority in the Monday review queue. If a problem is urgent, ask on Discord and include the short version, a repro, and the relevant logs.

### Why do some issues get no reply?

A reply is maintenance work too. Low-signal issues, unclear reports, duplicates, and issues that do not follow this guide may be closed without discussion. This keeps time available for reproducible bugs, thoughtful requests, and contributors who have done the work to make their report actionable.

### Why not let AI triage everything?

AI can help group duplicates, summarize reports, and spot missing information. It is not trusted to make final maintainer decisions. Polished AI-generated issues can still be wrong, misleading, or expensive to investigate. Human review remains the final gate.

### Is this hostile to contributors?

No. It is a guardrail against burnout and tracker spam. Short, concrete, reproducible issues are welcome. Thoughtful contributions are welcome. Automated slop, entitlement, and large volumes of low-effort reports are not.

## Where can I learn about plans?

Earendil uses RFCs to discuss larger changes.  Not all of them are public, but
quite a few are.  They can be found at [rfc.earendil.com](https://rfc.earendil.com/keyword/pi/).
