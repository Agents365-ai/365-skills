## Quickstart

This page gets you from install to a useful first pi session.

## Install

Pi is distributed as an npm package:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

`--ignore-scripts` disables dependency lifecycle scripts during install. Pi does not require install scripts for normal npm installs.

### Uninstall

Use the package manager that installed pi. The curl installer uses npm globally, so curl and npm installs are removed with npm:

```bash
# curl installer or npm install -g
npm uninstall -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

# pnpm
pnpm remove -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

# Yarn
yarn global remove @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

# Bun
bun uninstall -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Uninstalling pi leaves settings, credentials, sessions, and installed pi packages in `~/.pi/agent/`.

Then start pi in the project directory you want it to work on:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pi
```

## Authenticate

Pi can use subscription providers through `/login`, or API-key providers through environment variables or the auth file.

### Option 1: subscription login

Start pi and run:

```text
/login
```

Then select a provider. Built-in subscription logins include Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex), and GitHub Copilot.

### Option 2: API key

Set an API key before launching pi:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pi
```

You can also run `/login` and select an API-key provider to store the key in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`.

See [Providers](providers.md) for all supported providers, environment variables, and cloud-provider setup.

## First session

Once pi starts, type a request and press Enter:

```text
Summarize this repository and tell me how to run its checks.
```

By default, pi gives the model four tools:

- `read` - read files
- `write` - create or overwrite files
- `edit` - patch files
- `bash` - run shell commands

Additional built-in read-only tools (`grep`, `find`, `ls`) are available through tool options. Pi runs in your current working directory and can modify files there. Use git or another checkpointing workflow if you want easy rollback.

## Give pi project instructions

Pi loads context files at startup. Add an `AGENTS.md` file to tell it how to work in a project:

```markdown
# Project Instructions

- Run `npm run check` after code changes.
- Do not run production migrations locally.
- Keep responses concise.
```

Pi loads:

- `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` for global instructions
- `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from parent directories and the current directory

If a directory contains `AGENTS.override.md`, Pi loads it instead of `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from that directory.

Restart pi, or run `/reload`, after changing context files.

## Common things to try

### Reference files

Type `@` in the editor to fuzzy-search files, or pass files on the command line:

```bash
pi @README.md "Summarize this"
pi @src/app.ts @src/app.test.ts "Review these together"
```

Images or text can be pasted with Ctrl+V (Alt+V on Windows); images can also be dragged into supported terminals.

### Run shell commands

In interactive mode:

```text
!npm run lint
```

The command output is sent to the model. Use `!!command` to run a command without adding its output to the model context.

### Switch models

Use `/model` or Ctrl+L to choose a model for the current session. Press Ctrl+S in the model picker to save the highlighted model as the startup default. Use `/thinking` to choose a thinking level for the current session, or Ctrl+S in that picker to save the startup default thinking level. Use Shift+Tab to cycle thinking level. Use Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P to cycle through scoped models.

### Continue later

Sessions are saved automatically:

```bash
pi -c                  # Continue most recent session
pi -r                  # Browse previous sessions
pi --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
pi --session <path|id> # Open a specific session
```

Inside pi, use `/resume`, `/new`, `/tree`, `/fork`, and `/clone` to manage sessions.

### Non-interactive mode

For one-shot prompts:

```bash
pi -p "Summarize this codebase"
cat README.md | pi -p "Summarize this text"
pi -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"
```

Use `--mode json` for JSON event output or `--mode rpc` for process integration.

## Using Pi

This page collects day-to-day usage details that do not fit on the quickstart page.

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface has four main areas:

- **Startup header** - shortcuts, loaded context files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - user messages, assistant responses, tool calls, tool results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - where you type; border color indicates the current thinking level
- **Footer** - working directory, session name, token/cache usage, cost, context usage, and current model. Totals include assistant responses, usage reported by tools, and summary generation.

The editor can be replaced temporarily by built-in UI such as `/settings` or by custom extension UI.

### Editor Features

| Feature | How |
| --------- | ----- |
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Press Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line input | Shift+Enter, or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal |
| Copy response | Ctrl+X copies the selected message in `/tree`; otherwise it copies the last assistant message, or the active fullscreen text selection when `fullscreenCopyOnSelect` is disabled |
| Images | Paste with Ctrl+V, Alt+V on Windows, or drag into the terminal |
| Shell command | `!command` runs and sends output to the model |
| Hidden shell command | `!!command` runs without sending output to the model |
| External editor | Ctrl+G opens `externalEditor`, `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, Notepad on Windows, or `nano` elsewhere |

See [Keybindings](keybindings.md) for all shortcuts and customization.

## Slash Commands

Type `/` in the editor to open command completion. Extensions can register custom commands, skills are available as `/skill:name`, and prompt templates expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `/login`, `/logout` | Manage OAuth or API-key credentials |
| [`/llama`](llama-cpp.md) | Download, load, and unload llama.cpp router models |
| `/model` | Switch models; Ctrl+S in the picker saves the startup default |
| `/thinking` | Switch thinking level; Ctrl+S in the picker saves the startup default |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Theme, message delivery, transport, and other preferences |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session file, ID, messages, tokens, and cost |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/trust` | Save project trust decision for future sessions |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optionally with custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML or JSONL |
| `/import <file>` | Import and resume a session from a JSONL file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and context files |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit pi |

## Message Queue

You can submit messages while the agent is still working:

- **Enter** queues a steering message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls.
- **Alt+Enter** queues a follow-up message, delivered after the agent finishes all work.
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to the editor.
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to the editor.

On Windows Terminal, Alt+Enter is fullscreen by default. Remap it as described in [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) if you want pi to receive the shortcut.

Configure delivery in [Settings](settings.md) with `steeringMode` and `followUpMode`.

## Sessions

Sessions are saved automatically to `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, organized by working directory.

```bash
pi -c                  # Continue most recent session
pi -r                  # Browse and select a session
pi --no-session        # Ephemeral mode; do not save
pi --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
pi --session <path|id> # Use a specific session file or session ID
pi --fork <path|id>    # Fork a session into a new session file
```

Useful session commands:

- `/session` shows the current session file and ID.
- `/tree` navigates the in-file session tree and can summarize abandoned branches.
- `/fork` creates a new session from an earlier user message.
- `/clone` duplicates the current active branch into a new session file.
- `/compact` summarizes older messages to free context.

See [Sessions](sessions.md) and [Compaction](compaction.md) for details.

## Context Files

Pi loads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` at startup from:

- `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` for global instructions
- parent directories, walking up from the current working directory
- the current directory

If a directory contains `AGENTS.override.md`, Pi loads it instead of `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from that directory. Context files from other directories still layer normally.

Use context files for project conventions, commands, safety rules, and preferences. Disable loading with `--no-context-files` or `-nc`.

### System Prompt Files

Replace the default system prompt with:

- `.pi/SYSTEM.md` for a project
- `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md` globally

Append to the default prompt without replacing it with `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` in either location.

### Project Trust

On interactive startup, pi asks before trusting a project folder that contains project-local settings, resources, or project `.agents/skills` and has no saved decision for the folder or a parent folder in `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`. Trusting a project allows pi to load `.pi/settings.json` and `.pi` resources, install missing project packages, and execute project extensions.

Before the trust decision, pi loads only context files, user/global extensions, and CLI `-e` extensions so they can handle the `project_trust` event. Project-local extensions, project package-managed extensions, and project settings are loaded only after the project is trusted. This split also applies when switching to a session from a different cwd whose trust has not been resolved in the current process.

Non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--mode json`, and `--mode rpc`) do not show a trust prompt. Without an applicable saved trust decision, they use `defaultProjectTrust` from global settings: `ask` (default) and `never` ignore those project resources, while `always` trusts them. Pass `--approve`/`-a` or `--no-approve`/`-na` to override project trust for one run.

If no extension or saved decision applies, `defaultProjectTrust` controls the fallback behavior. Set it to `"ask"`, `"always"`, or `"never"` in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, or change it with `/settings`.

`pi config` and package commands use the same project trust flow, except `pi update` never prompts. Pass `--approve` to trust project-local settings for one command or `--no-approve` to ignore them.

Use `/trust` in interactive mode to save a project trust decision for future sessions, including trust for the immediate parent folder. It writes `~/.pi/agent/trust.json` only; the current session is not reloaded, so restart pi for changes to take effect.

## Exporting and Sharing Sessions

Use `/export [file]` to write a session to HTML.

Use `/share` to upload a private GitHub gist with a shareable HTML link.

If you use pi for open source work and want to publish sessions for model, prompt, tool, and evaluation research, see [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). It publishes sessions to Hugging Face datasets.

## CLI Reference

```bash
pi [options] [--] [@files...] [messages...]
```

### Package Commands

```bash
pi install <source> [-l]     # Install package, -l for project-local
pi remove <source> [-l]      # Remove package
pi uninstall <source> [-l]   # Alias for remove
pi update [source|self|pi]   # Update pi only, or one package source
pi update --all              # Update pi and packages; reconcile pinned git refs
pi update --extensions       # Update packages only; reconcile pinned git refs
pi update --models           # Refresh model catalogs only
pi update --self             # Update pi only
pi update --extension <src>  # Update one package
pi list                      # List installed packages
pi config                    # Enable/disable package resources
```

These commands manage pi packages and `pi update` can update the pi CLI installation. To uninstall pi itself, see [Quickstart](quickstart.md#uninstall). `pi config` and project package commands accept `--approve`/`--no-approve` to trust or ignore project-local settings for one command. `pi update` never prompts for project trust.

See [Pi Packages](packages.md) for package sources and security notes.

### Modes

| `--mode rpc` | RPC mode over stdin/stdout; see [RPC mode](rpc.md) |
| `--export <in> [out]` | Export a session to HTML |

In print mode, pi also reads piped stdin and merges it into the initial prompt:

```bash
cat README.md | pi -p "Summarize this text"
```

### Model Options

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `--provider <name>` | Provider, such as `anthropic`, `openai`, or `google` |
| `--model <pattern>` | Model pattern or ID; supports `provider/id` and optional `:<thinking>` |
| `--api-key <key>` | API key, overriding environment variables |
| `--thinking <level>` | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `--models <patterns>` | Comma-separated patterns for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `--list-models [search]` | List available models |

### Session Options

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `-c`, `--continue` | Continue the most recent session |
| `-r`, `--resume` | Browse and select a session |
| `--session <path\|id>` | Use a specific session file or partial UUID |
| `--fork <path\|id>` | Fork a session file or partial UUID into a new session |
| `--session-dir <dir>` | Custom session storage directory |
| `--no-session` | Ephemeral mode; do not save |
| `--name <name>`, `-n <name>` | Set session display name at startup |

### Tool Options

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `--tools <list>`, `-t <list>` | Allowlist specific built-in, extension, and custom tools |
| `--exclude-tools <list>`, `-xt <list>` | Disable specific built-in, extension, and custom tools |
| `--no-builtin-tools`, `-nbt` | Disable built-in tools but keep extension/custom tools enabled |
| `--no-tools`, `-nt` | Disable all tools |

Built-in tools: `read`, `bash`, `powershell` (Windows), `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`.

### Resource Options

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `-e`, `--extension <source>` | Load an extension from path, npm, or git; repeatable |
| `--no-extensions` | Disable extension discovery |
| `--skill <path>` | Load a skill; repeatable |
| `--no-skills` | Disable skill discovery |
| `--prompt-template <path>` | Load a prompt template; repeatable |
| `--no-prompt-templates` | Disable prompt template discovery |
| `--theme <path>` | Load a theme; repeatable |
| `--no-themes` | Disable theme discovery |
| `--no-context-files`, `-nc` | Disable `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` discovery |

Combine `--no-*` with explicit flags to load exactly what you need, ignoring settings. Example:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e ./my-extension.ts
```

### Other Options

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `--system-prompt <text>` | Replace default prompt; context files and skills are still appended |
| `--append-system-prompt <text>` | Append to system prompt |
| `--tui-mode <mode>` | TUI mode: `regular` (default) or experimental `fullscreen` |
| `--use-theme <name[/name]>` | Set the initial interactive theme for this run without changing settings |
| `--verbose` | Force verbose startup |
| `-a`, `--approve` | Trust project-local files for this run |
| `-na`, `--no-approve` | Ignore project-local files for this run |
| `--` | Stop option parsing; remaining arguments are prompts or `@file` inputs |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |
| `-v`, `--version` | Show version |

In `fullscreen` mode, the transcript scrolls inside the terminal viewport while queued messages, working status, extension widgets, editor, and footer remain fixed at the bottom. Mouse/trackpad input scrolls the region under the pointer; keyboard viewport actions always remain available. Inline images work in terminals that support the Kitty graphics protocol, including Kitty and Ghostty. In iTerm2 they render as text placeholders because its inline-image protocol cannot delete or crop placements during application-owned scrolling. In `regular` mode, pi uses the main screen and terminal-owned scrollback, and iTerm2 inline images continue to render normally. See [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) for terminal-specific settings and workarounds.

Set **TUI mode** in `/settings` to switch between `regular` and `fullscreen` immediately and choose the default for future sessions. **Fullscreen exit output** controls whether exiting fullscreen prints the final transcript or restores the previous screen and prints only the session resume hint.

### File Arguments

Prefix files with `@` to include them in the message:

```bash
pi @prompt.md "Answer this"
pi -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"
pi @code.ts @test.ts "Review these files"
```

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive with initial prompt
pi "List all .ts files in src/"

# Non-interactive
pi -p "Summarize this codebase"

# Prompt beginning with a dash
pi -p -- "- Summarize these points"

# Non-interactive with piped stdin
cat README.md | pi -p "Summarize this text"

# Named one-shot session
pi --name "release audit" -p "Audit this repository"

# Different model
pi --provider openai --model gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with provider prefix
pi --model openai/gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with thinking level shorthand
pi --model sonnet:high "Solve this complex problem"

# Limit model cycling
pi --models "claude-*,gpt-4o"

# Read-only mode
pi --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "Review the code"

# Disable one extension or built-in tool while keeping the rest available
pi --exclude-tools ask_question
```

## Design Principles

Pi keeps the core small and pushes workflow-specific behavior into extensions, skills, prompt templates, and packages.

It intentionally does not include built-in MCP, sub-agents, permission popups, plan mode, to-dos, or background bash. You can build or install those workflows as extensions or packages, or use external tools such as containers and tmux.

For the full rationale, read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/).

---

## Environment Variables

Pi uses environment variables in three ways:

- Variables such as `PI_OFFLINE` configure the Pi process.
- Pi sets process markers so child processes can identify Pi as the launching agent.
- Commands run by the LLM-callable shell tools receive `PI_*` variables describing the current session.

Provider API-key variables are documented separately in [Providers](providers.md#environment-variables-or-auth-file).

## Process Marker

The CLI and RPC entry points set two process markers:

- `AI_AGENT=pi` is a generic marker that lets tooling identify Pi as the agent that launched the process.
- `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` is Pi-specific and lets child processes detect that they run inside Pi.

Child processes inherit both markers. They are not session-specific and are not set automatically when Pi is embedded through the SDK.

## Shell Tool Session Environment

Commands run by the `bash` and `powershell` tools receive the current Pi session state:

| Variable | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `PI_SESSION_ID` | Current session ID |
| `PI_SESSION_FILE` | Absolute path to the current session JSONL file; unset for ephemeral sessions |
| `PI_PROVIDER` | Currently selected model provider |
| `PI_MODEL` | Currently selected model ID |
| `PI_REASONING_LEVEL` | Current effective reasoning level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` |

The values are resolved when each command starts. Switching models or changing the reasoning level therefore affects the next shell command without restarting Pi. `PI_PROVIDER` and `PI_MODEL` identify the selected Pi model, not a different upstream model that a router may choose internally.

When asked which model or provider is running, inspect these variables instead of inferring the answer from the system prompt:

```bash
printf '%s/%s\n' "$PI_PROVIDER" "$PI_MODEL"
printf 'reasoning=%s session=%s\n' "$PI_REASONING_LEVEL" "$PI_SESSION_ID"
```

The session file can be inspected directly when the session is persistent:

```bash
if [ -n "$PI_SESSION_FILE" ]; then
  tail -n 1 "$PI_SESSION_FILE"
fi
```

These variables are injected into the LLM-callable `bash` and `powershell` tools. They are not injected into user-entered `!` or `!!` commands.

### Custom Shell Tools

Tools created with `createBashTool()` or `createPowerShellTool()` expose the session environment by default when registered with Pi. Injection happens before `spawnHook`, so a hook receives the variables in `ctx.env`:

```typescript
const bashTool = createBashTool(cwd, {
  spawnHook: (ctx) => ({
    ...ctx,
    env: { ...ctx.env, CI: "1" },
  }),
});
```

Disable session metadata independently of the spawn hook:

```typescript
const powershellTool = createPowerShellTool(cwd, {
  exposeSessionEnvironment: false,
  spawnHook: (ctx) => ctx,
});
```

When disabled, Pi removes inherited values for these variables so nested Pi processes do not expose stale parent-session metadata.

## Pi Process Configuration

These variables are read by Pi itself:

| Variable | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Override the config directory; default is `~/.pi/agent` |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` | Override session storage; overridden by `--session-dir` |
| `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` | Override the package directory, useful for Nix/Guix store paths |
| `PI_SERVER_DIR` | Override the experimental server profile and socket directory; default is `~/.pi/server` |
| `PI_SERVER_ID` | Select the logical experimental server ID when `--server-id` is omitted |
| `PI_OFFLINE` | Disable startup network operations, including update checks, package updates, and install/update telemetry |
| `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` | Disable the `pi.dev` latest-version request |
| `PI_TELEMETRY` | Override install/update telemetry and provider attribution headers: `1`/`true`/`yes` or `0`/`false`/`no` |
| `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` | Set to `long` for extended provider prompt caching where supported |
| `PI_SHARE_VIEWER_URL` | Override the base URL used by `/share` |
| `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR` | Set to `1` to show the hardware cursor; see [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) |
| `PI_HYPERLINKS` | Override OSC 8 hyperlink detection with `1`, `0`, or `auto` |
| `PI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL` | Override inline image detection with `kitty`, `iterm2`, `none`, or `auto` |
| `PI_TRUE_COLOR` | Override truecolor detection with `1`, `0`, or `auto` |
| `PI_TUI_ESC_TIMEOUT` | How long to wait after a lone ESC before treating it as Escape, in milliseconds; defaults to `100` over SSH and `10` otherwise. Increase if Alt-key input is misread as Escape |
| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | External editor fallback when `externalEditor` is unset |
| `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` | Proxy outbound HTTP requests |

Provider credentials such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and cloud-provider configuration are listed in [Providers](providers.md#environment-variables-or-auth-file).

## Sessions

Pi saves conversations as sessions so you can continue work, branch from earlier turns, and revisit previous paths.

## Session Storage

Sessions auto-save to `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, organized by working directory. Each session is a JSONL file with a tree structure.

```bash
pi -c                  # Continue most recent session
pi -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions
pi --no-session        # Ephemeral mode; do not save
pi --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
pi --session <path|id> # Use a specific session file or partial session ID
pi --fork <path|id>    # Fork a session file or partial session ID into a new session
```

Use `/session` in interactive mode to see the current session file, session ID, message count, tokens, and cost.

For the JSONL file format and SessionManager API, see [Session Format](session-format.md).

## Session Commands

| Command | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `/resume` | Browse and select previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set the current session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info |
| `/tree` | Navigate the current session tree |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Summarize older context; see [Compaction](compaction.md) |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |

## Resuming and Deleting Sessions

`/resume` opens an interactive session picker for the current project. `pi -r` opens the same picker at startup.

In the picker you can:

- search by typing
- toggle path display with Ctrl+P
- toggle sort mode with Ctrl+S
- filter to named sessions with Ctrl+N
- rename with Ctrl+R
- delete with Ctrl+D, then confirm

When available, pi uses the `trash` CLI for deletion instead of permanently removing files.

## Naming Sessions

Use `/name <name>` to set a human-readable session name:

```text
/name Refactor auth module
```

Set the name at startup with `--name` or `-n`:

```bash
pi --name "Refactor auth module"
pi --name "CI audit" -p "Review this build failure"
```

Named sessions are easier to find in `/resume` and `pi -r`.

## Branching with `/tree`

Sessions are stored as trees. Every entry has an `id` and `parentId`, and the current position is the active leaf. `/tree` lets you jump to any previous point and continue from there without creating a new file.

<p align="center"><img src="images/tree-view.png" alt="Tree View" width="600"></p>

Example shape:

```text
├─ user: "Hello, can you help..."
│  └─ assistant: "Of course! I can..."
│     ├─ user: "Let's try approach A..."
│     │  └─ assistant: "For approach A..."
│     │     └─ user: "That worked..."  ← active
│     └─ user: "Actually, approach B..."
│        └─ assistant: "For approach B..."
```

### Tree Controls

| Key | Action |
| ----- | -------- |
| ↑/↓ | Navigate visible entries |
| ←/→ | Page up/down |
| Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→ | Fold/unfold or jump between branch segments |
| Shift+L | Set or clear a label on the selected entry |
| Shift+T | Toggle label timestamps |
| Enter | Select entry |
| Escape/Ctrl+C | Cancel |
| Ctrl+O | Cycle filter mode |

Filter modes are: default, no-tools, user-only, labeled-only, and all. Configure the default with `treeFilterMode` in [Settings](settings.md).

### Selection Behavior

Selecting a user or custom message:

1. Moves the leaf to the selected message's parent.
2. Places the selected message text in the editor.
3. Lets you edit and resubmit, creating a new branch.

Selecting an assistant, tool, compaction, or other non-user entry:

1. Moves the leaf to that entry.
2. Leaves the editor empty.
3. Lets you continue from that point.

Selecting the root user message resets the leaf to an empty conversation and places the original prompt in the editor.

## `/tree`, `/fork`, and `/clone`

| Feature | `/tree` | `/fork` | `/clone` |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Output | Same session file | New session file | New session file |
| View | Full tree | User-message selector | Current active branch |
| Typical use | Explore alternatives in place | Start a new session from an earlier prompt | Duplicate current work before continuing |
| Summary | Optional branch summary | None | None |

Use `/tree` when you want to keep alternatives together. Use `/fork` or `/clone` when you want a separate session file.

## Branch Summaries

When `/tree` switches away from one branch to another, pi can summarize the abandoned branch and attach that summary at the new position. This preserves important context from the path you left without replaying the whole branch.

When prompted, choose one of:

1. no summary
2. summarize with the default prompt
3. summarize with custom focus instructions

See [Compaction](compaction.md) for branch summarization internals and extension hooks.

## Session Format

Session files are JSONL and contain message entries, model changes, thinking-level changes, labels, compactions, branch summaries, and extension entries.

For parsers, extensions, SDK usage, and the full SessionManager API, see [Session Format](session-format.md).

---

## Keybindings

All keyboard shortcuts can be customized via `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`. Each action can be bound to one or more keys.

The config file uses the same namespaced keybinding ids that pi uses internally and that extension authors use in `keyHint()` and injected `keybindings` managers.

Older configs using pre-namespaced ids such as `cursorUp` or `expandTools` are migrated automatically to the namespaced ids on startup.

After editing `keybindings.json`, run `/reload` in pi to apply the changes without restarting the session.

## Key Format

`modifier+key` where modifiers are `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `super` (combinable) and keys are:

- **Letters:** `a-z`
- **Digits:** `0-9`
- **Special:** `escape`, `esc`, `enter`, `return`, `tab`, `space`, `backspace`, `delete`, `insert`, `clear`, `home`, `end`, `pageUp`, `pageDown`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`
- **Function:** `f1`-`f12`
- **Symbols:** `` ` ``, `-`, `=`, `[`, `]`, `\`, `;`, `'`, `,`, `.`, `/`, `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `_`, `+`, `|`, `~`, `{`, `}`, `:`, `<`, `>`, `?`

Modifier combinations: `ctrl+shift+x`, `alt+ctrl+x`, `ctrl+shift+alt+x`, `super+k`, `ctrl+super+k`, `ctrl+1`, etc.

`super` bindings require a terminal that reports the modifier separately, typically through the Kitty keyboard protocol. They may not work in terminals without that support.

## All Actions

### TUI Editor Cursor Movement

| Keybinding id | Default | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `tui.editor.cursorUp` | `up` | Move cursor up, browsing older history at the top |
| `tui.editor.cursorDown` | `down` | Move cursor down, browsing newer history at the bottom |
| `tui.editor.historyPrevious` | *(none)* | Select the previous prompt history entry |
| `tui.editor.historyNext` | *(none)* | Select the next prompt history entry |
| `tui.editor.cursorLeft` | `left`, `ctrl+b` | Move cursor left |
| `tui.editor.cursorRight` | `right`, `ctrl+f` | Move cursor right |
| `tui.editor.cursorWordLeft` | `alt+left`, `ctrl+left`, `alt+b` | Move cursor word left |
| `tui.editor.cursorWordRight` | `alt+right`, `ctrl+right`, `alt+f` | Move cursor word right |
| `tui.editor.cursorLineStart` | `home`, `ctrl+home`, `ctrl+a` | Move to line start |
| `tui.editor.cursorLineEnd` | `end`, `ctrl+end`, `ctrl+e` | Move to line end |
| `tui.editor.jumpForward` | `ctrl+]` | Jump forward to character |
| `tui.editor.jumpBackward` | `ctrl+alt+]` | Jump backward to character |
| `tui.editor.pageUp` | `pageUp`, `ctrl+pageUp` | Scroll up by page |
| `tui.editor.pageDown` | `pageDown`, `ctrl+pageDown` | Scroll down by page |

The dedicated history actions always change history entries, regardless of the cursor position in a multiline prompt. Explicit history bindings take precedence over application actions while the main editor is focused, so binding `tui.editor.historyPrevious` to `ctrl+p` overrides model cycling in that context without changing `Ctrl+P` in selectors.

### TUI Editor Deletion

| Keybinding id | Default | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `tui.editor.deleteCharBackward` | `backspace` | Delete character backward |
| `tui.editor.deleteCharForward` | `delete`, `ctrl+d` | Delete character forward |
| `tui.editor.deleteWordBackward` | `ctrl+w`, `alt+backspace` | Delete word backward |
| `tui.editor.deleteWordForward` | `alt+d`, `alt+delete` | Delete word forward |
| `tui.editor.deleteToLineStart` | `ctrl+u` | Delete to line start |
| `tui.editor.deleteToLineEnd` | `ctrl+k` | Delete to line end |

### TUI Input

| Keybinding id | Default | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `tui.input.newLine` | `shift+enter`, `ctrl+j` | Insert new line |
| `tui.input.submit` | `enter` | Submit input |
| `tui.input.tab` | `tab` | Tab / autocomplete |

### TUI Kill Ring

| Keybinding id | Default | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `tui.editor.yank` | `ctrl+y` | Paste most recently deleted text |
| `tui.editor.yankPop` | `alt+y` | Cycle through deleted text after yank |
| `tui.editor.undo` | `ctrl+-` (`ctrl+z` on Windows; `alt+z` on WSL) | Undo last edit |

### TUI Clipboard and Selection

| Keybinding id | Default | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `tui.input.copy` | `ctrl+c` | Copy selection |
| `tui.select.up` | `up` | Move selection up |
| `tui.select.down` | `down` | Move selection down |
| `tui.select.pageUp` | `pageUp` | Page up in list |
| `tui.select.pageDown` | `pageDown` | Page down in list |
| `tui.select.confirm` | `enter` | Confirm selection |
| `tui.select.cancel` | `escape`, `ctrl+c` | Cancel selection |

### TUI Fullscreen Viewport

These actions apply when interactive mode uses `--tui-mode fullscreen` and target the primary transcript scroll region. Two-finger trackpad and mouse-wheel input scroll the region under the pointer, falling back to the transcript over the fixed editor/status/footer dock. Clicking an OSC 8 hyperlink opens it in the default handler. Dragging with the primary mouse button selects text and copies it to the clipboard; holding at the transcript's top or bottom edge auto-scrolls into off-screen content. While the transcript is scrolled up, a clickable "Jump to latest message" label on its bottom row shows the `tui.altScreen.bottom` shortcut. See [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) for terminal-specific mouse and trackpad behavior.

Fullscreen transcript bindings take precedence over editor bindings. The default unmodified navigation keys therefore control the transcript in fullscreen mode, while their `ctrl` variants continue to control the editor. Outside fullscreen mode, both variants control the editor.

The transcript search panel shows the configured previous/next shortcuts and clickable arrow controls. Press `tui.altScreen.search` again, or use `tui.altScreen.searchClose`, to close it.

| Key | Default mode | Fullscreen mode |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| `home`, `end` | Editor | Transcript |
| `ctrl+home`, `ctrl+end` | Editor | Editor |
| `pageUp`, `pageDown` | Editor | Transcript |
| `ctrl+pageUp`, `ctrl+pageDown` | Editor | Editor |

This routing remains configurable through the ordinary action bindings. For example, `"tui.altScreen.pageUp": "ctrl+pageUp"` makes `pageUp` control the editor and `ctrl+pageUp` control the transcript in fullscreen mode. Bind `tui.altScreen.halfPageUp` and `tui.altScreen.halfPageDown` for half-page steps, or bind `tui.altScreen.lineUp` and `tui.altScreen.lineDown` for single-line steps. Setting `"tui.altScreen.pageUp": []` disables that transcript shortcut entirely. User bindings replace the defaults for that action.

| `tui.altScreen.nextPrompt` | `ctrl+shift+down`, `ctrl+down` (`ctrl+down` only on Windows and WSL) | Jump to the next marked message |
| `tui.altScreen.search` | `ctrl+shift+f` (`ctrl+f` on Windows and WSL) | Search the rendered transcript |

## Custom Configuration

Create `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "tui.editor.historyPrevious": "ctrl+p",
  "tui.editor.historyNext": "ctrl+n",
  "tui.editor.deleteWordBackward": ["ctrl+w", "alt+backspace"]
}
```

Each action can have a single key or an array of keys. User config overrides defaults.

On native Windows, `app.suspend` has no default binding because Windows terminals do not support Unix job control. If you bind it manually, pi shows a status message instead of suspending. In WSL, the normal Linux `ctrl+z`/`fg` behavior still applies.

### Emacs Example

```json
{
  "tui.editor.historyPrevious": "ctrl+p",
  "tui.editor.historyNext": "ctrl+n",
  "tui.editor.cursorLeft": ["left", "ctrl+b"],
  "tui.editor.cursorRight": ["right", "ctrl+f"],
  "tui.editor.cursorWordLeft": ["alt+left", "alt+b"],
  "tui.editor.cursorWordRight": ["alt+right", "alt+f"],
  "tui.editor.deleteCharForward": ["delete", "ctrl+d"],
  "tui.editor.deleteCharBackward": ["backspace", "ctrl+h"],
  "tui.input.newLine": ["shift+enter", "ctrl+j"]
}
```

### Vim Example

```json
{
  "tui.editor.cursorUp": ["up", "alt+k"],
  "tui.editor.cursorDown": ["down", "alt+j"],
  "tui.editor.cursorLeft": ["left", "alt+h"],
  "tui.editor.cursorRight": ["right", "alt+l"],
  "tui.editor.cursorWordLeft": ["alt+left", "alt+b"],
  "tui.editor.cursorWordRight": ["alt+right", "alt+w"]
}
```
